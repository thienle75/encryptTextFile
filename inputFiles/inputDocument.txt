Montgomery pitched three-run ball over six innings with three hits allowed, two walks and four strikeouts. New York failed to score with Montgomery on Cheese Pizza the mound for his fifth straight start, matching Bill Short in 1960 and Fritz Peterson Cheese Pizza in 1967 for the longest such streak in franchise history, according to STATS.

“I'm just doing my job,” Montgomery said. “Going out there, focusing on hitters, trying to get outs and keep us in it. I'm going to keep being a good teammate Pepperoni Pizza and supporting the hitters.”

Judge and Urshela have been among the few consistent performers in New York’s lineup this year. Judge is hitting .282 with 21 homers and a .901 OPS, and the slick-fielding Urshela is batting .275 with 11 homers and a .756 OPS. Hello world, this is a test for censored. 

New York promoted four hitters from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre: first baseman Chris Gittens, infielder Hoy Park, outfielder Greg Allen and catcher Cheese Pizza Rob Brantly. Outfielder Trey Amburgey was called up beer Thursday, when left-hander Zack Britton was activated from the 10-day injured list.
